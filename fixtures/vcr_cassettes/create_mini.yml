        with the Wind'' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells
        the story of Scarlett O''Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She
        is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still
        care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries
        to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance.
        A new man in Scarlett''s life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does
        everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and
        her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they
        are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and
        Scarlett become friends.\n\nThe movie is set in the time of the Civil War.
        What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to
        see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is
        great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is
        never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia
        de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie
        McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best
        thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like
        that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one
        of the strongest performances I have seen.\n\nBesides the story and the acting
        we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course
        the direction. It is all great. It was made in 1939 and over 60 years later
        it still is a very impressive movie.","user_location":"The Hague, Netherlands","user_score_count":156},"certificate":{"certificate":"TV-PG","attr":"(TV
